## Basic Calculator
This C program performs a simple calculation based on three arguments taken from the command line (first number, operator, and second number), and prints the result to the screen. 
It converts character strings to the long data type using the ft_atoi function and performs the calculation using the ft_calculator function. If the user does not provide the correct number of arguments, it prints an appropriate message to the screen.
